## Quick Example

```bash
# Generate a complete resource with one command
python cli.py make:resource Post \
  -f title:string:required,max:200 \
  -f body:text:required \
  -f author_id:integer:foreign:users.id \
  -m -p
```

This single command generates:
- SQLModel with proper field types and constraints
- Pydantic schemas with automatic validations
- Controller with full CRUD operations
- Protected routes with authentication
- Alembic migration files
